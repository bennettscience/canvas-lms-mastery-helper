            This application is meant to help you gather and sort through
            Outcome data in Canvas.
            <b>It is still in testing, so please be patient.</b> Currently, you
            can do everything <em>except</em> sync grades to Canvas.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
            If you don't have any courses in the left sidebar, click
            <b>Add new course</b> at the top left to import one. Your students
            are automatically imported.
        </p>
        <p>
            Open a course by clicking its card on the left. Import Outcomes and
            Assignments you'd like to track.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you have some materials imported, Outcomes watch Assignments
            and update the score when it's over your Mastery Score. Set each
            alignment on the Outcome card.
        </p>
        <video muted loop autoplay>
            <source src="static/img/alignment.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            <source src="static/img/alignment.webm" type="video/webm" />
        </video>
        <p>
            Student attempts are available on each outcome. Click the student's
            score to see the attempts listed by date. If more that one attempt
            has been imported, a trendline is also displayed. Outcome attempts
            are imported for all courses nightly.
        </p>

        <p>
            Set your mastery score calculation, your mastery score, and manage
            your imported courses in the Preferences section.
